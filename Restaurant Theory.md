## Restaurant Theory

1. divide all the features of your product into **menu** items, or **ingredients**
2. menu items are advertised front of house, in a big way
3. ingredients are not advertised

Take all the things you love about your product and place each into one of two columns, menu-items and ingredients.
Your menu items are what you advertise and sell, and you *must* sell them in a big way.
If you are not comfortable making a feature a headline feature, it belongs in the ingredients list.

Ingredients are only interesteing to other chefs.
They seem important, but the ingredients are not what sells the dish.
